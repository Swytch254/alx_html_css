    <p>This article is about bears. Polar bears, mama bears and panda bears.</p>
    <p>Not much is known about polar and panda bears but make sure you dont mess with mama bears.</p>
    <p>Mama bears are cuddly, loving and warm but can be very unpleasant if provoked.</p>
    <p>Especially when they go to work and tell you to defrost the chicken but you forget to do it coz you were playing video games.</p>
